# Lesson 3

# Operators, Conditions and Loops

# 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations

Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints the results of:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

```bash
# Example of expected output:
The first number: 5
The second number: 2
Addition: 7
Subtraction: 3
Multiplication: 10
Division: 2.5
```

## Bonus!

If you'd like to try get a bit more fancy, use the `input()` function to get the user to manually add the two values instead of assigning them to the variables in your code.

# 2. Modulus and Exponentiation

Write a Python program that takes a number and prints:

- The remainder when divided by 3 (using the modulus operator %)
- The number raised to the power of 2 (using the exponentiation operator \*\*)

```bash
# Example of expected output:
The number is: 7
Remainder when divided by 3: 1
Number raised to the power of 2: 49
```

# 3. Odd or Even

Write a Python program that checks if a number is odd or even.
Use the modulus operator and an if statement.

```bash
# Example of expected output:
The number is: 4
The number is even.
```

# 4. Compare Two Numbers

Write a Python program that takes two numbers and prints whether:

- The first number is greater than the second
- The second number is greater than the first
- The two numbers are equal

```bash
# Example of expected output:
The first number is: 10
The second number is: 20
The second number is greater than the first.
```

# 5. Print Numbers 1 to 10

Write a Python program that uses a for loop
to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

```bash
# Example of expected output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

# 6. Multiplication Table

Write a Python program that takes a number and prints the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) for that number.

```bash
# Example Output:
The number is: 3
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
```

# Bonus Questions (Optional)

# 7. FizzBuzz

Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20.
But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

```bash
# Example output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

# 8. Leap year

Write a Python program that asks the user to input a year and checks whether it is a leap year or not.

A year is considered a leap year if it satisfies the following conditions:

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except:
If the year is divisible by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
In other words:

A year that is divisible by 400 is always a leap year.
A year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 is not a leap year.
A year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 is a leap year.
Any other year is not a leap year.
Your program should output whether the input year is a leap year or not.

```bash
# Example:
Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year.
Enter a year: 1900
1900 is not a leap year.
```

# Happy coding!
