# DWP Berlin S25 Coding Fundamentals
Repository for the Coding Fundamentals class of Digital Women Program - Berlin Spring 2025

## Learners
Welcome! 
On this repo you can find
- Weekly homework/task assignment
- Code examples was used during the class `# starting from lesson-2`
- Final Project structure and models `# Soon...`


## Teachers: How to contribute

### Creating a new weekly assignment
- create a new directory inside /homework following the pattern
- inside the directory you created, add the challenges/exercises + instructions in a README.md file. We love [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)🥰
- do not add main.py file, even empty. the reason for it is because we want to avoid triggering git conflicts when learners pull this remote repo from their forked

### Adding weekly assignment solution
- inside /homework/lesson-* create a new directory called solution
- add the solution on a main.py file
- preferably push it on the week after the lesson was given, so the learners can have access to it

### code examples from session
you can add the code example/snippets you have during the session on this repo as well!
